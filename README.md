# Writing-Test-Specifications

In Test Driven Development (TDD) projects, it is important to determine which tests need to be written for a project, feature, or piece of code. These tests range from unit tests, which check the expected result of calling a specific function or piece of code, to functional tests, which verify the behavior of a website or app when a user performs some action.

In this workshop, we will be writing test specifications for a series of prompts. The test specifications should be clear and concise, covering all possible edge cases while avoiding extraneous tests.

Writing clear and concise test specifications is a crucial step in TDD projects. By considering all possible edge cases and avoiding extraneous tests, we can ensure that our code is thoroughly tested and works as intended.
